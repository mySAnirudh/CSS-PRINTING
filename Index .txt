
     **** PRINTING ****

     You can use CSS to change the appearance of your web page when it is printed 
on a paper. You can specify one font for the screen version and another for the 
print version.
You have seen @media rule in the previous chapters. This rule allows you to 
specify different styles for different media. So, you can define different rules for 
a screen and a printer.
The following example specifies different font families for screen and printer. The 
next CSS uses the same font size for both screen as well as printer.
<style tyle="text/css">
<!--
@media screen
{
p.bodyText {font-family:verdana, arial, sans-serif;}
}
@media print
{
p.bodyText {font-family:georgia, times, serif;}
}
@media screen, print
{
p.bodyText {font-size:10pt}
}
-->
</style>
